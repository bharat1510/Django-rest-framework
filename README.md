# Django-rest-framework
The Python web framework **Django** is extensively used nowadays. Working with various APIs in the system, Django provides a Rest API framework that makes it easier for a developer to perform different operations. **Django REST Framework** is an easy, flexible, and powerful toolkit for building Web APIs. By using DRF, we can convert the entire non-RESTful application into a RESTful one.
